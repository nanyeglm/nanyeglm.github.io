I am a **PhD student in Pharmacology** at the School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, [China Pharmaceutical University](https://www.cpu.edu.cn/) (中国药科大学). My research focuses on **AI-driven Drug Discovery** and **Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD)**.

## Research Interests

My research is dedicated to artificial intelligence and computer-aided molecular drug design methods and applications. I use molecular simulation, AI, computational biology, and AI-assisted drug molecular design techniques to study the structure, function, and dynamic processes of important drug targets. Through the organic combination of chemical/biological experiments, I accelerate the discovery of drug molecules, including:

- **Lead Compound Discovery & Optimization**: Structure-based virtual screening, homology modeling, target fishing, scaffold hopping, ADMET prediction
- **AI-based Drug Toxicology Prediction**: Building interpretable organ-level toxicology prediction models using machine learning methods
- **Target-based Drug Molecular Design**: Integrating deep generative models with structure-based drug design methods to discover selective STAT3 inhibitors
- **AI-empowered Nucleic Acid Drug Development**: Design of various nucleic acid drugs including linear mRNA and siRNA
